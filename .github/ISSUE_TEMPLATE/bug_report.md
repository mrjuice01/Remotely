<!--
PLEASE READ:

Thank you for your interest in Remotely.  Please understand that Remotely is a hobby project that I develop in between working full time and raising a family.

As such, the time I can devote toward the project is very limited, and I simply don't have the availability to help with issues related to hosting or configuration, or ones that aren't specifically related to the application code.

Your bug must meet the following requirements, or else it will be closed.  For issues that don't meet these requirements, please reach out to the community on the official subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/remotely_app/) or in the Discussion areas on GitHub.

Requirements:
    - The bug must be related specifically to application code (e.g. not related to hosting, reverse proxy configuration, etc.).

    - It must be immediately reproducible, either in a debug environment or on https://app.remotely.one.  (This doesn't apply to bugs that are clearly code-related.)

    - Repro steps must be included.  The more information, the better.  Pretend you're getting a support request from one of your clients, and think about the kinds of details you want them to include.

    - Remotely does not support localization.  If the bug is related to language or regional settings, there is likely little I can do.

Again, thank you for your interest in the project, and thank you for your understanding.
